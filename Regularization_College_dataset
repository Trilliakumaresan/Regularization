Here, tried to explore the application of regularization techniques, specifically Ridge and Lasso regression, to predict graduation rates using the College dataset. 
Regularization methods are essential in addressing overfitting and improving the generalization performance of predictive models. 
In this analysis, we aim to build and compare Ridge and Lasso regression models, evaluate their predictive performance, 
and assess the impact of regularization on model coefficients. 
The College dataset contains information about various factors influencing graduation rates in colleges, such as application statistics, 
faculty demographics, and financial expenditure. 
By leveraging this dataset, we seek to understand how different features contribute to graduation rates and whether regularization techniques can 
enhance model interpretability and predictive accuracy.
